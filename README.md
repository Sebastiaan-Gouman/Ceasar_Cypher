# Introduction
I created this Ceasar Cypher tool simply to have some fun coding, and understanding the easiest cypher there is. It's not very useful otherwise, since it provides no real cryptographic power and, as you can experience yourself, can be brute forced really simple. So, don't use this to encrypt something important!

Other than that, it's just a simple Python file you can run in the command line, and the code is easy enough to understand for everyone trying some basic coding and cryptography. 

The software I used to create this is PyCharm, to also get the hang of using GitHub I pushed these files to the repository using the built-in version control that PyCharm offers. 

That's all for now, remember this software is for education purpose only!

# Functions

### caesar_cipher
1. The function takes two arguments, `text` (the text to encrypt) and `shift` (amount of positions to shift)
2. The loop checks for every character in the `input` if it's an alphabetic letter.
3. Encryption
   - If it's a letter, it shifts with the amount in the `shift` argument
4. Non-alphabetic sings will be added to the result without change.
5. The result is the encrypted or decrypted text

Since the new_char line might be a little complicated, let me explain it in more detail:
1. The function `ord()` gives an ASCII value to the character in `char`. For example, `ord('a')` gives value 97.
2. Now `ord(char) - ascii_offset` simply subtracts the value from the `char` from the `ascii_offset`. For example, `ord('c')` would be 99, and it would subtract 97, which would give us 2. This would mean that 'c' has the second position in the alphabet (zero indexed, that is).
3. The next step `ord(char) - ascii_offset + shift` adds the shift. This is just a simple addition. If the shift is '3', the 'c' from the previous step now gets moved to position 5, which is an 'f'.
4. This modulo part `% 26` makes sure this also works when the shift exceeds the alphabet limits. For example, if we add 3 to the 'z' (position 25, remember the zero index) it gets position 28, and `28 % 26 = 2` which corresponds with 'c'.
5. Now we need to add the offset one more time with: `+ ascii_offset`, so that it shifts back to the right position. 
6. Since we have constantly been using ASCII tabel numbers instead of letters we need to convert it with `chr(...)`. For example, `chr(70)` would give us 'F'.  

```
def caesar_cipher(text, shift):
    result = ""
    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha():
            ascii_offset = ord('a')
            new_char = chr((ord(char) - ascii_offset + shift) % 26 + ascii_offset)
            result += new_char
        else:
            result += char

    return result
```

### sanitize_input
This function makes sure the user input is sanitized first, before being used for the cypher function. This prevents errors when running the program.
First it removes spaces, this is not completely neccesary but hey, the code should at least do something right?
Next it changes all characters to lower case, this makes it a little harder to decypher the encrypted text as it doesn't show the beginning of a new sentence.

```
def sanitize_input(input):
    remove_spaces = input.replace(' ', '')
    final_string = remove_spaces.lower()
    return final_string
```


### welcome_message
The welcome message does exactly what you might expect it to do. 
No much to explain here.

# GitHub
If you have come this far, I assume you have been looking through everything and might have noticed the little stormy Git history. I found it rather confusing at times, and so I experimented some with adding, ignoring and deleting files here and there.
The commands I learned are `git rm --cached test.py` and `git commit -m "Stop tracking test.py"` to remove the cashed version of a file, and to commit the changes to the Git history. I will keep experimenting with this to get the hang of it.
